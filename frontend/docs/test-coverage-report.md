## Untested Code Analysis

### Components with Low Coverage

1. **Dashboard.jsx**: 
   - No tests implemented yet
   - Key untested functionality: layout rendering, navigation handling

2. **Profile.jsx**:
   - No tests implemented yet
   - Key untested functionality: user profile display, form updates

3. **Navbar.jsx**:
   - No tests implemented yet
   - Key untested functionality: navigation links, conditional rendering based on auth state

4. **Settings.jsx**:
   - No tests implemented yet
   - Key untested functionality: user preferences management

### Specific Uncovered Areas in Tested Components

1. **Login.jsx**:
   - Password reset functionality: 0% coverage
   - Some edge cases in form validation: ~21% of branches uncovered

2. **Notes.jsx**:
   - Complex filtering logic: ~25% of branches uncovered
   - Some error handling paths: ~15% uncovered
   - Modal animations and transitions: not tested

3. **AuthContext.jsx**:
   - Token refresh mechanism: ~12% uncovered
   - Some error handling paths: ~10% uncovered

## Test Coverage Over Time

| Date | Statement % | Branch % | Function % | Line % |
|------|------------|----------|------------|--------|
| Current | 82% | 78% | 85% | 83% |
| Target (End of Q2) | 90% | 85% | 95% | 90% |

## Coverage Improvement Plan

1. **Short-term (2 weeks)**:
   - Implement tests for Dashboard.jsx
   - Increase Notes.jsx branch coverage to 85%
   - Implement tests for Login password reset functionality

2. **Medium-term (1 month)**:
   - Implement tests for all remaining components
   - Reach 85% statement coverage across all files
   - Add tests for uncovered edge cases in Notes.jsx

3. **Long-term (3 months)**:
   - Reach 90% or higher coverage across all metrics
   - Implement end-to-end tests for critical user journeys
   - Add visual regression testing for UI components

## Critical Paths to Test

These critical paths should be prioritized for testing:

1. **User Authentication Flow**:
   - Login → Dashboard → Logout
   - Login failure handling
   - Session persistence

2. **Note Management Flow**:
   - Create → Read → Update → Delete
   - Error handling during each operation
   - Concurrent edits handling

3. **Search and Filter Flow**:
   - Search functionality
   - Filter application
   - Combined search and filter

## Recommendations

1. **Component-Specific Tests**:
   - Implement tests for all untested components starting with Dashboard
   - Focus on increasing branch coverage in Notes.jsx
   - Add tests for edge cases in authentication flows

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Add more comprehensive user flow tests
   - Test interactions between multiple components
   - Add tests for error propagation across components

3. **Coverage Monitoring**:
   - Add coverage tracking to CI pipeline
   - Set up alerts for coverage regression
   - Make coverage reports accessible to all developers

## Conclusion

The current test coverage exceeds the minimum threshold of 70% for all metrics, which is a good starting point. However, significant portions of the codebase remain untested, particularly several UI components. Following the outlined improvement plan will help reach the target coverage of 90% across all metrics, ensuring a more robust and reliable application.
